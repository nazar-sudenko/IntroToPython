#Write a Python program to ask user the day, month, and year they were born, and print day/month/year.
#E.g. if the user will give 15, 8, 2004, print 15/8/2004. (NOTE: no need to convert input to int here)

D = input("Enter your day of birth: ")
M = input("Enter your month of birth: ")
Y = input("Enter your year of birth: ")

print(D + "/" + M + "/" + Y)
